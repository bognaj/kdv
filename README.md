# Korteweg-De Vries equation 

Project prepared for Partial Differential Equations with Applications in Physics and Industry on Faculty of Mathematics at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology. 
The co-author is Piotr Rogula - https://github.com/rogulforce. 

The project presents the numerical solution do KdV equation. We used the method of finite differences, different accuracies have been implemented. 
The core of the solution is Zabusky-Kruskal scheme.
